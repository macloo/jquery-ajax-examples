# jQuery Ajax examples

Some files for easy reference.

[`$.ajax()` example with `$.map()`](https://macloo.github.io/jquery-ajax-examples/ajax-and-map.html) — gets a JSON file with 65 Harry Potter characters in it and formats all the text and writes it into the HTML.

[`$.getJSON()` example with `$.map()`](https://macloo.github.io/jquery-ajax-examples/getJSON-and-map.html) — this is the same as the previous file, but using the `$.getJSON` method instead of `$.ajax`.

[Ajax/jQuery.getJSON Simple Example](https://www.sitepoint.com/ajaxjquery-getjson-simple-example/) is a nice explainer about `$.getJSON`.
