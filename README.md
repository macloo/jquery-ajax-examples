# jQuery Ajax examples

Some files for easy reference.

[`$.ajax()` example with `$.map()`](https://macloo.github.io/jquery-ajax-examples/ajax-and-map.html) — gets a JSON file with 65 Harry Potter characters in it and formats all the text and writes it into the HTML.

[`$.getJSON()` example with `$.map()`](https://macloo.github.io/jquery-ajax-examples/getJSON-and-map.html) — this is the same as the previous file, but using the `$.getJSON` method instead of `$.ajax`.

[Ajax/jQuery.getJSON Simple Example](https://www.sitepoint.com/ajaxjquery-getjson-simple-example/) is a nice explainer about `$.getJSON`.

[`$.ajax()` example with `$.each()`](https://macloo.github.io/jquery-ajax-examples/ajax-and-each.html) — no Harry Potter here. U.S. presidential portraits instead. `$.map()` returns a new array, containing all the stuff you requested from the server. `$.each()` just loops and does whatever you say — no new array. Here jQuery detects which president you clicked, finds his data on the server, and gives you a pop-up card full of facts about him.
